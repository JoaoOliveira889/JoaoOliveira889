#Hi 🖖🏼 I'm João!
<br>

<p>My name is Joao Oliveira. I've been passionate about technology since childhood, I always liked is learn and discovering how things work. My focus is on the backend development, with C# and .Net, but I love studying new languages, and technologies, mainly about the best practices, patterns, and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Alway that possible, I'm contributing to the community. I create content about development and technology over the Medium and LinkedIn, you can find all these links below.</p>
